# How it works
The function we want to draw:  
`f(x) = an*x^n + ... + a1 * x + a0`  
problem occurs when we try to draw non-integer x

Define:
- `g(x) := f(x/scalex)` which will scale f(x) in x axis for scalex. Using `g(x)` we can calculate for example f(0.1) with scalex=10 and x=1. `g(x)` can be scaled in y by multiplying it by `scaley`. If `scalex = scaley` then the graph of function we get is visually the same as f(x).
- `quotx := scaley * scalex^n`

`g(x) = an * (x/scalex)^n + ... + a1 * x/scalex + a0`  
multiplying both sides with scalex^n yields  
`h(x) := scalex^n * g(x) = an * x^n + ... + a1 * scalex^(n-1)* x + a0 * scalex^n`
giving us the function `h(x)` generated by `prepareTerms` routine and used to calculate values.  

the function
`scaley * g(x) = h(x)/quotx` is the actual function being drawn in [-40, 40]x[-12, 12] coordinate system.
